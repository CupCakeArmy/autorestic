# ðŸ’½ Backends

Backends are the outputs of the backup process. Each location needs at least one.

Note: names of backends MUST be lower case!

```yaml | .autorestic.yml
version: 2

backends:
  name-of-backend:
    type: local
    path: /data/my/backups
```

## Types

We restic supports multiple types of backends. See the [full list](/backend/available) for details.

## Avoid Generating Keys

By default, `autorestic` will generate a key for every backend if none is defined. This is done by updating your config file with the key.

In cases where you want to provide the key yourself, you can ensure that `autorestic` doesn't accidentally generate one for you by setting `requireKey: true`.

Example:

```yaml | .autorestic.yml
version: 2

backends:
  foo:
    type: local
    path: /data/my/backups
    # Alternatively, you can set the key through the `AUTORESTIC_FOO_RESTIC_PASSWORD` environment variable.
    key: ... your key here ...
    requireKey: true
```

With this setting, if a key is missing, `autorestic` will crash instead of generating a new key and updating your config file.
